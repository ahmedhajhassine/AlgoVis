# AlgoVis 🎨

A comprehensive algorithm visualization tool designed to help students and developers understand how algorithms work through interactive visual demonstrations.

## Overview

AlgoVis is an educational platform that brings algorithms to life through dynamic visualizations. Watch sorting algorithms rearrange elements, see pathfinding algorithms explore graphs, and understand data structure operations step-by-step with clear, animated visuals.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: See algorithms in action with smooth, real-time animations
- **Multiple Algorithm Categories**: 
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
  - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, etc.)
  - Dynamic programming examples
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for learning and teaching algorithm concepts
- **Step-by-Step Control**: Play, pause, and step through each operation
- **Customizable Input**: Test algorithms with different data sets and parameters
